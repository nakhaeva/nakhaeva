## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m a newbie in programming, so please be patient with me!

I'm currently interested in Data Analytics, but I possess some knowledge about Web-programming as well.

âš¡ Fun fact: I really love learning new languages! I speak Russian, Kalmyk, English and recently I've started learning Chinese. I hope I'll start speaking fluently in this language next year. Wish me good luck!
